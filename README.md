# Habitability_Score_Prediction
Created a smart computer program that predicts how livable a home is on a scale of 1 to 100. Using information from nearly 40,000 properties, I cleaned up messy data, found important patterns, and picked out the most useful details about each home. My first attempt was okay, getting it right about 60% of the time. But then I built a more advanced system using artificial intelligence techniques that got it right 82% of the time, with predictions off by only 4.3 points on average. This smart system looks at 6 key features of a home to make its prediction. To make it easy for anyone to use, I put it online with a simple website where you can enter details about a home and instantly get a livability score. This project shows how we can use technology to help people understand the quality of homes, which could be super useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
